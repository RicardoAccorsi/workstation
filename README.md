# Simulation of a Manufacturing System using ARENA

## Overview

This project simulates a manufacturing system consisting of four workstations (A, B, C, and D) using ARENA simulation software. The system receives three different parts, and each part follows a specific route through the workstations. The arrival of parts follows an exponential distribution with a mean interarrival time of 10 minutes. Workstation A has two machines, while workstations B, C, and D each have one machine.

## Project Components

1. **ARENA Model**: The simulation model is built using ARENA software, which provides a graphical interface for modeling and simulating manufacturing systems.

2. **Arrival Process**: Parts arrive at the system according to an exponential distribution with a mean interarrival time of 10 minutes.

3. **Workstations**: There are four workstations in the system: A, B, C, and D. Workstation A has two machines, while the others have one machine each.

4. **Processing Times**: The processing times for each part and workstation vary, simulating the variability in manufacturing processes.

## Objectives

The objectives of this simulation project include:

- Analyzing the throughput and utilization of each workstation.
- Identifying bottlenecks in the manufacturing process.
- Evaluating the overall efficiency and performance of the system.

## Implementation

The simulation model is implemented using ARENA simulation software. The model includes entities representing parts, workstations, and queues. Process logic is defined to simulate the flow of parts through the system, including arrival, processing, and departure.

## Results

The simulation results will provide information on the throughput, utilization, and efficiency of each workstation in the manufacturing system. Additionally, the model can be used to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement in the manufacturing process.
